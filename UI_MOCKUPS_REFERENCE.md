These mockups provide a comprehensive visual foundation for the AudioVR mobile app implementation, demonstrating how accessibility-first design can create beautiful, immersive experiences that serve users regardless of their abilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Use mockups as pixel-perfect reference for React Native implementation
2. Extract individual UI components from mockup designs
3. Create animation specifications based on interactive elements shown
4. Test color contrast and accessibility features in real app builds
5. Validate voice command patterns with actual users during testing

The mockups successfully translate the technical specifications into tangible visual designs that development teams can implement directly.
